This simple C++ program calculates the buoyant force acting on an object submerged in a fluid (such as water) and determines whether the object will float, sink, or remain neutrally buoyant.
For now, this runs in the console, I will change this as I upgrade and add features to the program. 

The calculation is based on Archimedes’ Principle, which states that the buoyant force on an object equals the weight of the displaced fluid.

The user enters:

The volume of the object (in cubic meters, m³) and The weight of the object (in Newtons, N)

The program calculates the buoyant force using:

$$
F_b = \rho_{fluid} \times V_{object} \times g
$$
